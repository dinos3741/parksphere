feat: Implement request declined notification

This commit introduces a new feature that notifies the requester when a spot owner declines their parking spot request.

Changes include:
- Server-side: Modified the `declineRequest` socket handler in `server/index.js` to emit a `requestDeclined` event to the requester with a specific message.
- Client-side:
  - Added a new `SpotDeclinedModal` component (`client/src/components/SpotDeclinedModal.js` and `.css`) to display the notification.
  - Updated `client/src/App.js` to import and render the new modal, and to listen for the `requestDeclined` socket event to trigger the modal display.
